# Hey there, I am Henry Jones
## Thank you for trying out my Food Diary application
### If you have any questions or just want to reach out you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-jones-717235158/)
#### In order to get the application to work you are going to need to install flask, I reccomend using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
##### Then just enter pip install flask in the command prompt, run the App.py document and you are good to go
Once the webpage opens everything should be fairly straightforward, get to entering your meals and enjoy
